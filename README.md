# Thomas Noell's gitHub

Hello, my name is Thomas Noell!
This is my github page where I will be posting different scripts here that I have worked on.
I will also add self evaluation of projects I have worked on to this README file.

Files:

VoicePlayer.cs
- This file is used in Buds as the script related to voice acting. In order for it to work the YarnSpinner plug-in is required.

Jerry Needs A Girl (Folder)
- This folder is holding the unity files related to an independent project Jerry Needs A Girl. Once I have a prototype here,
a repository for the game will be made.
